# Kitsune Compiler

Why the name kisune?
_idk sounded cool_

#### Why make a compiler?

> "Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast
> quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning
> reward of art." - Frédéric Chopin

Wanted to understand code execution at a low-level.
I am still building this and I just know that hard concepts
in this field are vital. It is guaranteed that I will
become better programmer by taking the challenging route in 
the beggining.

### What is different about this compiler from the rest.

Nothing. I just want to practice. Once I know the basics of this and
study more I can design it to fix annoyances from other programming
languages. An example from this can be ~~Javascript~~ Typescript.

## Current Progress

- [x] Lexer, Intigers and Code Generation
- [ ] Unary, Binary Operators and local variables :hammer:
- [ ] Conditionals and Compound Statements
- [ ] Loops, Functions, and Global Variables
